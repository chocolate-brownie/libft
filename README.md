# libft
libft project is to develop a custom library in C, called libft, that mimics standard C library functions.

The **libft** project at **École 42 Paris** is a foundational part of the curriculum designed to help students build a comprehensive understanding of C programming and the creation of a custom library. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the project:

### **Objective**

The main objective of the libft project is to develop a custom library in C, called `libft`, that mimics standard C library functions. This involves writing your own versions of commonly used functions found in the C Standard Library, like string manipulation, memory management, and more. The project aims to:

1. **Improve understanding of C:** Strengthen students' grasp of C programming language concepts.
2. **Learn library functions:** Understand how standard library functions work under the hood by implementing them from scratch.
3. **Enhance debugging skills:** Foster debugging skills by identifying and fixing issues in your implementations.
4. **Improve code quality:** Develop an appreciation for writing clean, efficient, and reusable code.

### **Project Structure**

The project is typically divided into several parts:

#### **Part 1: Basic Functions**

Students need to implement a set of fundamental functions that handle basic tasks like:

- **String manipulation:** Functions like `ft_strlen`, `ft_strcpy`, `ft_strdup`, etc.
- **Memory management:** Functions like `ft_memset`, `ft_memcpy`, `ft_memmove`, etc.
- **Character checks:** Functions like `ft_isalpha`, `ft_isdigit`, `ft_isalnum`, etc.
- **Conversion functions:** Functions like `ft_atoi` (ASCII to integer), etc.

#### **Part 2: Additional Functions**

This part requires the implementation of slightly more complex functions that provide additional functionality, including:

- **String manipulation:** Functions like `ft_strjoin`, `ft_substr`, `ft_strtrim`, etc.
- **Linked lists:** Basic linked list operations, such as adding or removing nodes.

### **Learning Outcomes**

Completing the libft project allows students to:

- **Deepen their understanding of C:** Gain a thorough understanding of core C programming concepts and memory management.
- **Improve problem-solving skills:** Develop skills to think critically and solve problems effectively.
- **Gain confidence in coding:** Increase confidence in coding, debugging, and testing C programs.
- **Learn project management:** Experience managing a significant coding project, from planning to implementation and testing.
